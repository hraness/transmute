Init writes a new editable source bundle and job. Bundle retains only explicitly listed
files without executing them. After source edits, bind the returned bundleSha256 into
a new job ID. Plan is inert; probe loads the selected installed engine and fixed driver.
Run executes trusted current-user native source without an OS sandbox. Runtime plugins
and ambient dependencies are not fully hermetic. Provider credentials are not inherited.
Blender/Cycles GPU requests fail if unavailable; no CPU fallback is implicit. Native
scenes, simulation caches and exact frames remain retained beside verified receipts.
Reconcile can restore a missing receipt only after a closed successful completion and
an unchanged validation checkpoint. Ambiguous work is never automatically resubmitted.

For local SDK workflows, code run, workflows run and runs resume accept
--studio-python <venv-python>, --studio-blender-bin <executable> and
--allow-trusted-code. Runtime selection alone grants no authored-code permission.
The fixed local operation is slopcamera.studio.run; its SDK surface is studio.run().`,
  direct: `Usage:
  slopcamera direct init <recipe.json> [--json]
  slopcamera direct anchor --input <image> [--json]
  slopcamera direct plan <recipe.json> [--json]
  slopcamera direct start <recipe.json> --budget-usd <USD> [--json]
  slopcamera direct inspect <direct-id> [--json]
  slopcamera direct revise <direct-id> --recipe <recipe.json> [--json]
  slopcamera direct generate <direct-id> --shot <shot-id> --attempt <take-id>
        --allow-paid-generation [--allow-cloud-upload] [--allow-reference-hosting] [--json]
  slopcamera direct cleanup <direct-id> --attempt <take-id> [--json]
  slopcamera direct resume <direct-id> --attempt <take-id> [--json]
  slopcamera direct review <direct-id> --attempt <take-id>
        --decision accepted|rejected --note <review> [--json]
  slopcamera direct assemble <direct-id> [--json]

Init writes a new recipe without overwriting. Edit its ID, shots, prompts and settings.
Anchor imports one explicit local image and returns a hash-bound source reference.
Plan checks live Gateway video capabilities and duration pricing without a paid call.
Start retains one budget for the direct ID; starting again cannot reset it.
Generate dispatches at most one new take and requires a unique take_<id>. Local images,
including a predecessor's endpoint, require --allow-cloud-upload on that invocation.
URL-only models require --allow-reference-hosting and a private Vercel Blob store.
Only exact reference images receive short-lived signed read URLs. Signed URLs and
credentials are not saved. Cleanup deletes those exact objects; inspect cleanup
receipts and use direct cleanup after interruptions. Blob charges are separate
from the model catalog estimate and require room in your overall spending limit.
Every dispatched, rejected, or ambiguous take retains its catalog cost reservation.
These USD reservations are estimates, not settled invoices or a provider-enforced cap.
Resume only reconciles retained local receipts and extracts missing endpoints; it never
resubmits a provider call. A completed take can be accepted after reviewing its video.
A shot-end reference uses the accepted predecessor's actual final decoded frame.
Revising a shot or choosing a different predecessor makes affected downstream takes stale.
Assemble requires current accepted takes for all shots and publishes an ordinary video
project for slopcamera project render run. Review and assembly work without cloud credentials.
This workflow retains image and prompt continuity; it has no provider neural checkpoint
or real-time session. Use slopcamera ai models list --type video for live model discovery.`,
  scene: `Usage:
  slopcamera scene init <scene.json> [--json]
  slopcamera scene check <scene.json> [--json]
  slopcamera scene inspect <scene.json> [--json]
  slopcamera scene patch <scene.json> --patch <patch.json> --output <new-scene.json> [--json]
  slopcamera scene evaluate <scene.json> --camera <camera-id> --time-us <integer> [--json]
  slopcamera scene camera-track <scene.json> --request <sampling.json> --output <new-track.json> [--json]
  slopcamera scene plan|render <scene.json> --request <request.json> [--assets <bindings.json>] [--profile <profile>] [--json]
  slopcamera scene project snapshot <project-id> [--json]
  slopcamera scene project prepare-render <project-id> --input <request.json> --output <prepared-render.json> [--profile <profile>] [--json]
  slopcamera scene project migrate|patch|restore|add-shot|add-candidate|select-candidate|reconcile
        <project-id> --input <request.json> [--json]
  slopcamera scene world import --input <import.json> --source-root <directory>
        --output-root <directory-below-artifacts/slopcamera/generated> [--json]

Hardware profiles: three-webgl2-hardware-v1 and three-spark-webgl2-hardware-v1.
An explicit profile must agree with the request; omitting it preserves the request.
Saved-world import works offline and preserves imported provenance receipts.
Scene sources retain stable entities, cameras, asset manifests and animation channels.
Inspect reports editable controls and known bounds without decoding assets. Patch requires
the exact expected scene digest in its patch document and writes a new source without
overwriting either revision. Evaluate samples absolute time without launching a renderer.
Project operations use the exact full project ID and a versioned whole-project basis.
Discover each request with slopcamera operations show spatial.project.<action> --json.
Migration retains the frozen media/edit pair in V2 authority. Legacy project commands
cannot modify a migrated project. Ambiguous publication returns its attempt for explicit
reconciliation and never automatically overwrites a later revision.`,
  diagram: `Usage:
  slopcamera diagram init [diagram.json]
  slopcamera diagram check <diagram.json> [--config <file>] [--strict]
  slopcamera diagram render <diagram.json> [--out-dir <directory>]
        [--config <file>] [--scale <number>]

These commands delegate to the canonical @hraness/slopcamera parser. Init never overwrites.
Check parses and lints without writing; --strict exits 2 on findings. Render replaces the same five
portable derivatives: editable .tldr plus light/dark SVG and PNG. The registered Slopcamera diagram
operations separately publish equivalent derivatives by content hash for workflow composition.`,
  image: `Usage:
  slopcamera image vectorize <raster-path> --output <file.svg> [--json]
        [--duotone '<#primary,#secondary>'] [--alpha-cutoff <n>] [--timeout-ms <n>]
  slopcamera image generate <prompt> --output <file.webp> [--model <model>]
        [--idempotency-key <key>] [--json]
  slopcamera image generate --model <gateway-model> --prompt <prompt>

Explicit --output file commands delegate to @hraness/slopcamera. Vectorization is local,
bounded, checksum-pinned, and emits inert SVG. File generation uses Vercel AI Gateway with the
caller's environment credential. The --prompt spelling without --output is an alias for the desktop
content-addressed \`ai image generate\` lane and returns project-composable content hash references.`,
  html: `Usage:
  slopcamera html catalog [--json]
  slopcamera html scaffold <${HTML_OVERLAY_SCAFFOLD_KIND_HELP}> --output <file.html>
  slopcamera html render --input <scene.json> [--dry-run] [--json]

Catalog lists the closed scaffold profiles in stable order with their primary jobs, render
substrates, and current exact browser-library versions. Scaffold creates a complete transparent
HTML overlay without overwriting an existing file. Scaffolds use the existing
@hraness/slopcamera/local/html-overlay API and exact locked import maps. Render the document through
workflow.media.htmlOverlay to receive a deterministic transparent video layer.

Render accepts a slopcamera.html-scene source, retains its HTML, declared resources and
optional local soundtrack, and returns an H.264/AAC MP4 plus an ordinary editable project
with separate scene-video and original-audio tracks. Device dimensions must be even integers.
Duration rounds up to whole frames; audio starts at zero and is trimmed or padded to that
duration. Soundtracks encode as 48 kHz stereo AAC at 320 kb/s. Dry run checks source and
workload bounds without launching a browser, importing audio, or writing project state.
Progress uses stderr; --json keeps stdout machine-readable.`,
  operations: `Usage:
  slopcamera operations list [--json]
  slopcamera operations show <kind>[@<version>] [--json]

Operation discovery is generated from the closed host registry. Workflow code may request these
operations but cannot override their schemas, privacy policy, resources, consent, or retry class.
List output is compact; show --json expands only the selected operation's input and output JSON
Schemas.`,
  workflows: `Usage:
  slopcamera workflows list [--json]
  slopcamera workflows show <id> [--json]
  slopcamera workflows plan <id> --input <json-file> [--json]
  slopcamera workflows run <id> --input <json-file> [--provider-options <json-file>]
        [--jobs <n>] [--json|--jsonl]
        [--studio-python <venv-python>] [--studio-blender-bin <executable>] [--allow-trusted-code]

Built-ins are explicit versioned TypeScript graph recipes over the same operation registry as
custom code. Planning resolves structural project identity and policy bounds without executing
registered effects. Workflow execution may still evaluate trusted repository code; it is not a
sandbox. List output is compact; show --json expands only the selected workflow's input JSON
Schema.

Provider options are invocation-scoped. The raw JSON is never stored in a run or journal; only its
digest and sorted provider namespaces enter the exact plan. A resume must supply the same file
before a matching paid Gateway request can dispatch.`,
  code: `Usage:
  slopcamera code init <path>
  slopcamera code check <path> [--json]
  slopcamera code plan <path> --input <json-file> [--json]
  slopcamera code run <path> --input <json-file> [--plan <sha256>]
        [--provider-options <json-file>] [--jobs <n>] [--json|--jsonl]
        [--studio-python <venv-python>] [--studio-blender-bin <executable>] [--allow-trusted-code]

Code mode bundles one repository-local TypeScript module and its physical local imports, builds a
strict typed operation graph in a separate process, and keeps stdout/stderr separate from framed
protocol data. --plan fails if source, input, structural bindings, registry, or runtime changed.
Raw provider options are ephemeral: only their digest and namespace list may enter an exact plan.

Trusted code mode is not a sandbox. Module top-level and later acknowledged compute callbacks run
with the current user's filesystem, process, and network authority. Slopcamera injects no
credentials or privileged handles into the worker.`,
  runs: `Usage:
  slopcamera runs list [--limit <n>] [--json]
  slopcamera runs show <run-id> [--nodes failed|all] [--json]
  slopcamera runs resume <run-id> [--replay-ambiguous-code <node-key> ...]
        [--provider-options <json-file>] [--jobs <n>] [--json|--jsonl]
        [--studio-python <venv-python>] [--studio-blender-bin <executable>] [--allow-trusted-code]
  slopcamera runs approve <run-id> <node-key> --preparation-plan <sha256> [--json]
  slopcamera runs approve <run-id> <node-key> --node-plan <sha256> [--json]
  slopcamera runs cancel <run-id> [--json]

Approvals bind one exact preparation or node plan. Approve records authority and releases the
claim; only a later resume executes work. A normal resume never evaluates persisted trusted code.
Each --replay-ambiguous-code option authorizes the exact bundle, compute callback, node plan, and
next attempt named by that node. Cancellation is durable and prevents new dispatch or publication
without rolling back already published outcomes. Paid Gateway nodes that reference provider
options require the digest-matching file again on resume; raw values are never recovered from the
run journal.`,
  ai: `Usage:
  slopcamera ai provider-options inspect <json-file> [--json]
  slopcamera ai models list [--type <all|image|video|speech|transcription>]
        [--provider <name>] [--query <text>] [--limit <n>] [--refresh] [--json]

        [--format <all|json|text|srt|vtt>] [--provider-options <json-file>]
        [--timeout <time>] [--json]

Set AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY in the process environment, or run through a linked Vercel project with
\`vercel env run -- slopcamera …\` so VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN is injected. Slopcamera never persists,
prints, or accepts either credential through argv.

The media-model catalog is fetched live from Vercel AI Gateway and cached with a deterministic
revision. Every image, video, speech, and batch-transcription model of the matching operation is
executable; streaming-only transcription models remain discoverable and are labeled as such.
models are not limited by a checked adapter roster. models show preserves the live provider
capabilities and exposes model-aware parameter hints.

Provider-specific options are read from one bounded JSON object. Its outer keys are provider
names and its values are arbitrary bounded JSON objects, so newly released model controls remain
available without a CLI update. gateway.models is rejected because fallback models have not been
independently catalog-validated or accounted. Provider-specific sample-count fields are rejected;
use --count with --max-per-call at least as large so one job remains one AI SDK call. Options may contain BYOK credentials, webhook
secrets, or similar sensitive values: keep the source JSON ignored and owner-protected. Slopcamera
persists only its digest and namespace list, never its raw values. Common video controls are
first-class flags, including primary image, first/last frames, image/audio/video references, count,
aspect ratio, resolution, duration, FPS, seed, and generated audio. Frame inputs and generic
references are mutually exclusive because the AI SDK otherwise ignores the references; a primary
image cannot accompany a first frame.

provider-options inspect emits exactly the secret-free {sha256,namespaces} reference that workflow
nodes store in their exact request; it never prints or persists the raw option values.

Reference media and transcription audio never upload implicitly. The appropriate explicit
--allow-cloud-* acknowledgement is required after local files pass type and byte bounds. Image
and video references may instead use a public credential-free HTTPS URL when the live catalog
permits URL input or does not declare a source restriction; an explicit non-URL source list fails
locally. Add a <media-type>= prefix when the URL path has no recognized extension. Private/local
literal targets are rejected, and receipts retain only the URL digest and media type, never the
URL. Direct URL arguments remain visible to shell and process history, so use only references safe
for that exposure. The AI SDK client uses
maxRetries=0, and Slopcamera never resubmits an ambiguous paid call. AI Gateway can still route or
fail over one request across multiple providers, so one command may have multiple provider
attempts; provider timeouts may still incur charges. Outputs and immutable receipts are written
under gitignored artifacts/slopcamera/generated/. Receipts report complete, partial, or overproduced
sample fulfillment. Self-describing generated media is fully decoded locally before an import
command is emitted; invalid paid bytes remain quarantined with no import command. Headerless PCM, L16, A-law, basic, and mu-law speech
is saved and hashed but receives no project-add command; convert it with explicit sample metadata
first.`,
  analyze: `Usage:
  slopcamera analyze faces <project> --source <asset:video-stream> [options] [--json]
  slopcamera analyze inactivity <recording|project> [options]
  slopcamera analyze zooms <recording> [--apply] [--json]

Scene options: --max-scene-duration <time> --scene-threshold <0..1>
               --model <google/gemini-*> --execute --allow-cloud-upload --json
Scene analysis is local planning by default. Execution uploads only selected derived frames and requires explicit acknowledgement.

Face options: --backend <auto|vision> --sample-fps <n>
              --min-confidence <0..1> --max-track-gap <time> --max-faces <n> --json
Face detection runs locally against immutable project media. Track IDs are geometry continuity only; no recognition, embeddings, names, crops, or cloud upload are produced.

Inactivity options: --min-duration <time> --motion-threshold <0..1>
                    --protect-audio <bool> --handle <cut|speed|keep>
                    --speed-rate <1..64> --apply --json
Projects analyze every enabled screen stream, optionally require silence on every enabled audio stream, and map reference-recording interactions through accepted placement sync. Project evidence is always persisted; --apply adds one global cut or speed decision per recommended range.

Speech options: --whisper <path> --language <auto|tag> --threads <n> --processors <n>
                --no-gpu --min-filler-confidence <0..1> --speech-handle <time>

  slopcamera align apply <project> <analysis-id> --candidate <id>
        [--reference-placement <id>] [--target-placement <id>] [--json]

Analysis writes immutable evidence. Automatic application requires an unambiguous high-confidence candidate; an explicit candidate may be applied after inspection.`,

Color grading supports --preset <clean|warm|cool|cinematic|vivid|flat|mono> plus independently
bounded --brightness, --contrast, --saturation, --gamma, --temperature, --tint, and
--hue-degrees controls.

Transforms call the checked local FFmpeg executable with an argv array, never a shell. They never
overwrite the source. Each output uses fresh no-replace publication, then post-render verification
and a receipt under gitignored artifacts/slopcamera/generated/. A crash after output publication but
before receipt publication can leave an orphan; the next run reports a conflict for explicit
inspection and removal. JSON output includes SHA-256 provenance and an exact project-add next
command.`,
  fillers: `Usage:
  slopcamera fillers list <project> <speech-analysis-id> [--auto-only] [--json]
  slopcamera fillers apply <project> <speech-analysis-id> <candidate-id> [--placement <id>] [--json]

Apply accepts only candidates with safe acoustic boundaries and current placement synchronization. Every enabled audio stream must have a current music analysis; all detected music is projected into project time and missing coverage or overlap fails closed. Manual project cuts remain available for editorial overrides.`,
  faces: `Usage:
  slopcamera faces list <project> <face-analysis-id> [--at <asset-time>]
        [--min-duration <time>] [--min-confidence <0..1>] [--limit <1..1000>] [--json]

Face track IDs describe local geometry continuity inside one immutable analysis. They do not identify a person.`,
  record: `Usage:
  slopcamera record start [--display <id> ...]
        [--camera-device <id>] [--microphone-device <id>]
        [--webcam <true|false>] [--microphone <true|false>]
        [--system-audio <true|false>] [--typed-text <true|false>]
        [--strict-inputs] [--json]
  slopcamera record pause|resume|stop|status [--json]

Capture defaults to every current display, system audio, the default microphone,
and the default camera. Repeat --display to record an exact non-empty subset.
Device IDs select the exact camera or microphone reported by slopcamera doctor;
unknown or duplicate IDs fail closed. Typed-text capture remains opt-in with
--typed-text true.`,

Imported media starts unverified. Align its audio before relying on synchronization. Structural edits are project-time operations and affect every placement. Camera moves address any placed video stream; metadata-driven screen zooms still require a recording-backed source placement. Face analysis and geometry tracks remain local. --select largest follows the largest currently visible prepared-layer face per frame. --require-all-selected makes a missing explicit/all-selected face invoke the chosen gap policy.`,
  render: `Usage: slopcamera render <plan|run> <recording> [--display <id|primary>] [--output <path>] [--dry-run] [--keep-inactivity] [--json]

Long inactivity is analyzed and removed by default; use --keep-inactivity to opt out.`,
